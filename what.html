            <h2>
                Augmented Reality
            </h2>

            <p>
                Augmented reality, or AR, is the result of using technology to superimpose information — sounds, images
                and text — on the world we see.
                You can experience augmented reality in two main ways:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Screen i.e. a smart device with a camera such as a phone or tablet
                </li>
                <li>
                    Augmented reality glasses / head set
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                So when you view the word through one of these devices, usually at a particular place that has an AR
                program set up,
                you can see the overlay of the virtual world on the real world.
            </p>


            <p>
                Head sets can cost anywhere from $1,500 to $3,000, but if you want to use just a screen from a phone or
                tablet, most apps are free or have a negligible one time cost.

            <h2>
                Mixed Reality
            </h2>

            <p>
                Mixed reality, or MR, sometimes refered to as hybrid or merged reality,
                is the merging of real and virtual worlds to produce new environments and visualizations where physical
                and digital objects co-exist and interact in real time.
                You can experience mixed reality in two main ways:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Screen i.e. a smart device with a camera such as a phone or tablet
                </li>
                <li>
                    Mixed reality head set with controllers
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                MR is a lot like AR, but instead of images just being superimposed onto the world, there is interaction
                and the "mixing" of the two difrent worlds.
            </p>
            <p>
                The head set and controller set are usually sold for about $150 to $500, but if you want to use just a
                screen from a phone or tablet, most apps are free or have a negligible one time cost.
            </p>

            <h2>
                Virtual Reality
            </h2>

            <p>
                Virtual reality, or VR, is an interactive computer-generated experience taking place within a simulated
                environment.
                Unlike AR and MR you can only experience virtual reality with a head set, but there are two main kinds:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    A head set without a screen where you use a smart phone as a screen- usually you don't use
                    controllers
                </li>
                <li>
                    Or a virtual reality head set that has a built in screen with controllers
                    -these are of higher quality and cand give you a better experience
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Also unlike in AR and MR, you don't see any of the real world and completely immersed into the virtual
                world.
            </p>
            <p>
                The head sets and controllers are usually sold for about $11 to $550, but if you want to use just a
                screen from a phone you could even create one from a cardboard kit.
