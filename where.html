                <p>
                    The Heroes and Legends exhibit located at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida has a great use of
                    augmented reality.
                    You can go to some and actually see people talking bout themselves.
                    One of the crown jewls of this exhibit is a hologram of Gene Cernan talking about and experiencing
                    what
                    his "Space walk from hell" was like.

                    The Kremer Museum
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The Kremer is thought to be the first museum to exist entirely within the virtual realm.
                    It was founded by art collectors George and JoÃ«l Kremer.
                    You can view seventy-four works by Dutch masters.
                    Each piece was photographed thousands of times, using a process known as photogrammetry,
                    recreating the art in amazing, three-dimensional detail.

                    Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History is located in Washington, D.C.
                    In their "Bone Hall" they now have 13 skeletons which can be enhanced with 3-D augmented reality.
                    If you get the smithsonisn's mobil app "Skin and Bones" then you experience flying vampire bats,
                    and see what animals would look like with skin and muscles.
