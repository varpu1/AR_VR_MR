        <h2>
            Augmenting Our View of Education for The Future
        </h2>

        <p>
            In todayâ€™s society, there is so much changing with technology and how people are using it to learn.
            We have gone from just paper, pencil, and brain power, to having calculators, to giant computers, to the
            sleek laptops, to what we have today.
            Now the majority of people are carrying around some sort of smart device, whether it be a laptop, tablet,
            phone or even watch, and in many cases it is almost mandatory to have some sort of device in order to keep
            up.
            Nowadays more and more schools are using and incorporating technology into their curriculums.
            Even other educational institutions are doing the same thing, using videos and interactive screens to help
            each student and the general public.
            With new technology emerging such as augmented reality as well as Virtual Reality, and 3D printers, the
            possibilities for the use of technology in educational situations could be boundless.
            It is time that we expand our use of the ever rapidly growing technology that our world is creating, and try
            incorporating more of it into how we can expand our knowledge and how we learn.
            Making it so that educational institutions use technology, such as augmented reality to further students
            education, and help change the way that we can learn.
        </p>
        <p>
            Kids these days are getting shorter and shorter attention spans and we need to engage them more in order to
            keep them interested in the material.
            A way that we can promote engagement and help spark more interest in subjects that are trying to be taught,
            such as the sciences, is by using more interactive technology and hands-on activities in educational
            settings.
            We can see that science museums especially have gotten a head start on the idea of interactive education.
        </p>
        <p>
            The use of interactive technologies, such as the different types of realities: AR, VR, and MR in our
            educational institutions would do wonders for the people of the world.
            It is time that we step foward and embrace the future.
            Out world is advancing with technology, our ways of education should do the same.
